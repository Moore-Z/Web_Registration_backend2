# Web_Registration_backend_logic

# Project Description

In this project, I built one common user registration web application with login part and registration part. In this project, I used Servlet, TomCat, Marven, MyBatis, MySQL in Java Language environemnt. In login part, we have two original username and their password in the MySql database. In the login html file, users can try to login the website by typing input username and password. So, the login html webapp will submit the user input username and password, if in our database there is one set of username and password fit the user input. Servelt will display "Loging success". Or it will display "Login Fail". 
In the registration part, user can type their desired useranme and password. After clicking the submit button, the username and password will update into the MySQL database. When I check all data from MySQL workbench, we can see all new user registrations. 

I used the Servlet framework to recieve data from website and dynamically make different responds like "Login success" or "Login failed". In the future, I user servlet display more information like another html file. 
I used the TomCat frameword to process the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with extremely easy and fast way. Also, using the Maven automation building tool help me to speed up the coding process. 
Last but not the least, I used the Mybatis frameword to process MySQL in the Java IDE.
